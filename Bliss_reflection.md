#What git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?
I had absolutely no idea how to handle a merge conflict, so I'm really glad I got that out of the way before it became an issue. Everything else I had a pretty good handle on, but I'm glad I was able to work through it with other people who knew what they were doing.

#What concepts were clarified during the GPS?
I'm writing this reflection a few days later and I've already run into a few merge conflict issues, so I'm really glad I got that figured out in this exercise. Adell also had a lot of suggestions on time saving devices and shortcuts that I will spend the next few weeks struggling to learn.

#What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?
Most of my questions were regarding the actual function of a command. Like with fetch/merge/pull, I knew basically what they all would do, but Adell helped me understand why they did that and when I would need each of them.

#What still confuses you about git?
I feel like, for my current purposes, nothing is confusing me, but I imagine at some point I will find myself running into issues if I try to pull off anything much more complicated. The only thing I still struggle with is every once in a while creating merge conflicts that I'm not sure how to solve. I think being more meticulous about pulling and merging before I continue working will really help me with that.

#How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?
This was my first pairing experience at all, so I was a little nervous, but Carl and Adell were really helpful and knowlegable. We created an environment that made it really easy to work and, whenever we ran into issues, we were always able to work through them.
