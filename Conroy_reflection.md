1. What git concepts were you struggling with prior to this GPS session?

I wasn't fully aware of how to do a local merge, so Charlie and I worked together and did some trial and error to come to a solution.  We also caught ourselves making small mistakes in the regular workflow and both improved because of it

2.  What concepts were clarified during the GPS?

We clarified the creation of best practices when creating a git commit

3.What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?

  We asked lots of questions about sublime and learned a number of shortcuts to make us better at using it.

4. What still confuses you about git?

Sometimes when I push things to github I still have issues with updates to repositories, but I'm working to get better at the whole workflow to avoid that.

5.  How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?

I think it went very well.  Charlie and I learned a lot and taught eachother things as we went along.
